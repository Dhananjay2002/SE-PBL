                  In publishing and graphic design, Lorem ipsum is a placeholder

                  Lorem ipsum may be used as a placeholder before the final copy
                  is available.James Abram Garfield (1831–1881) was the 20th
                  president of the United States, serving from March 4 to
                  September 19, 1881. Garfield was born into poverty in a log
                  cabin in Northeast Ohio. He was a Union major general during
                  the American Civil War. Elected to Congress in 1862 to
                  represent Ohio's 19th district, he served nine terms, gaining
                  a reputation as a skilled orator. He also wrote a notable
                  proof of the Pythagorean theorem, published in 1876. Selected
                  as a compromise candidate at the 1880 Republican National
                  Convention, Garfield won the general election. As president he
                  oversaw a resurgence of presidential authority against
                  senatorial courtesy in executive appointments, a purge of
                  corruption in the Post Office, and the appointment of a
                  Supreme Court justice. Garfield advocated an educated
                  electorate and civil rights for African Americans. He was shot
                  on July 2, 1881, and died from infections caused by his
                  doctors. (This article is part of a featured topic: 1880
